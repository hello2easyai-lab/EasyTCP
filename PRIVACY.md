EasyTCP Privacy Policy

Last Updated: December 7, 2025

1. Data Collection Statement

EasyTCP is a local TCP debugging tool that does not collect, store, or transmit any user data, including but not limited to:

- Personal identification information (name, phone number, email address, etc.)

- Network behavior data (TCP connection records, sent/received data content, IP addresses, etc.)

- Device information (device model, system version, hardware information, etc.)

2. Data Processing Explanation

All TCP connection establishment and data transmission operations are performed locally on the user's device. No data will be uploaded to any server, nor will any data be shared with third parties.

3. Permission Usage Explanation

The application only requests the "Outgoing Network Connection Permission" (for establishing TCP connections) and no other permissions. Permissions are only used temporarily during the application's runtime, and no permission-related data is retained.

4. Changes to This Privacy Policy

If this privacy policy is updated in the future, users will be notified in advance through application update descriptions or official channels.
